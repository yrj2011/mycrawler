@Scope
You can specify that your beans defined with the @Bean annotation should have a specific scope.The default scope is singleton, but you can override this with the @Scope annotation:

@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {
@Bean
@Scope("prototype")
public Encryptor encryptor() {
// ...
}
}
