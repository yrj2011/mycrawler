<bean id="triangle" class="org.shape.Triangle" name="tribhuj">	<!-- here 'name' attribute defines another name for 'triangle' bean -->

By using 'ref' attribute you can store names, references etc. as a property value. So if you want to force that a property MUST store an id(i.e. reference)
then you can use 'idref' instead of 'ref'. It's a kind of extra validation you are applying. So in this case if 'idref' contains a value which is not an 
id(i.e. reference) then an exception will be thrown at the time of bean initialization.
